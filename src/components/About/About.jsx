      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a highly driven individual with a penchant for learning and solving
        problems. I enjoy using react.js and vanilla CSS to build functional and
        responsive web applications. I am currently looking for a role as an
        associate software engineer. <br />I spend my free time reading,
        listening to music, playing chess and hiking with my dog Kimber. She
        makes sure I take some time away from coding.
