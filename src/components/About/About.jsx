      <p>
        I am a full stack software engineer with an entrepreneurial background
        and I thoroughly enjoy solving problems and then finding new ways to be
        efficient. I am an inquisitive learner and always looking for new ways
        to build quality applications that improve the lives of others. I am a
        team player and I enjoy working with others but also independently to
        solve problems.{' '}
