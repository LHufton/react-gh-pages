      <h2>Who I am.</h2>
      <p>
        I am an off the beaten path kinda guy who uses out of the box thinking
        to solve problems. I have an entrepreneurial background and have owned a
        successful roofing company.
      </p>
      <h2>What I like to do</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy a challenge and software engineering provides plenty of them. I
        am at my best when the problems I am solving have positive impact on our
        communities.
